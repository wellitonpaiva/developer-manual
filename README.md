# Developers manual
I've seen tons about how to be a manager or how to be a product owner but on the developer side, there's tons of book about languages, best practices on the code, how to develop your code but, at least I've never seen something explaining what and developer is, what they do or what they eat! I know that developer is a really, REAAAAALY broad term but I just want to try to write some guide to any starting or wannabe developer or a help for a junior developer looking for some example or how to improve his life as one developer.

Of course I don't have near 1% of the knowledge necessary to write this kind of document, but we always need to start and try and maybe in the future, with some community help, we can improve this and this become something? 

Imagine a book called "The developers guide to the Galaxy - do not throw the towel"!
